## ideas
- For the first feature, it is amazing when I look at it, it has been a big approvement compare to my lab1.
- For the second feature, I use some grid in css to layout my content.
- I already have responsive layout in previous submission, so today we only add submenu Oct.21 2023, hope this doesn't count my submission as late.
- I realize it's not necessary to make the webpage looks complicated, it's important to make it clean and looks confirtable.
